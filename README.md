Files are marked with suffixes `Before` and `After`,
to indicate the files before and after refactoring.
Sometimes there is a single .java file within the package.

It is understood that in real cases it would be appropriate to put each class in a separate file, instead of putting all the static classes together.

As well as unit tests should be created, before refactorings.


In the package `refactoring` there are refactorings that may be common to multiple Code Smell.
